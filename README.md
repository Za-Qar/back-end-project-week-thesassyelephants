# Mentor Matcher backend

This api acts as a backend for [this project]( https://github.com/Za-Qar/mentor_matcher-frontend_React).

The project is about matching programmers with mentees and mentors. On the frontend when a user logs in and fills out the form, their data is listened to here, then processed then sent to the database. When the users request data based on their requested criterion, then the data is retrieved from the database and sent to the frontend.
